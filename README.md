# countries_API
This project has been created to simulate a Server API that provides information about countries in the world.
It is based on the Rest Country API site, which is going to be putting down at the end of May 2023.
Since I have lectures about using this API with AJAX for my courses, I have decided reproduce its functionality 
locally (localhost).
Basically you run this api from VS Code and it creates the server api in your local machine at port 3000.
Then you can create your flask applications that fetch data from that server API.
